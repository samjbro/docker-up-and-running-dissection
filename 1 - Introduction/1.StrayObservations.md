# Chapter 1: Stray Observations

- There is a LOT of context necessary in order for me to properly understand all of this - hopefully 
Chapter 2 will help.
- It sounds like if I can get past the initial learning curve, Docker will really hammer home a lot of 
best practices.
- I recognise that I might be a little out of my depth right now, having never encountered most of these
application pipeline concepts. I intend to swim around in them until they sink in (mixed metaphor?).
- Looking for ways to not have to communicate with other departments or depend on anyone else is a very 
**me** thing to want to do - I'll have to be careful not to start down an isolating path.
- I still don't really know how applications are deployed - it would be nice to see something like that in
action, or maybe to find a really high-level overview of the entire process.
- Am I going to have to learn these other tools in order to get anywhere with Docker? I really hope not,
and should aim to cut them out wherever I can.
