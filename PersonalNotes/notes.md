# Personal Notes

- Where is the Docker server located when using Docker for Mac? I think maybe things have changed since this
  book was written, since the Docker for Mac documentation talks about the Docker daemon and the Docker engine,
  but not the Docker server. 
   
- Apparently Docker for Mac uses a Linux Virtual Machine created by Hyperkit for storing and running containers
  on a Mac.
nt logs can be easily followed.
