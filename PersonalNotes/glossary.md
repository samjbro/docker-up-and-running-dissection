# Glossary

__CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:__ The practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several
times a day.

__DYNAMIC LANGUAGE:__ A programming language optimised to maximise programming efficiency so that functionality
can be implemented with less code. Its key defining feature is that it can execute code at compile time and vice
versa, which makes possible such techniques as __Metaprogramming,__ programs that can modify themselves. Notable
examples include Javascript, Ruby, Lisp, Perl, Python. Contrast with __STATIC LANGUAGE.__

__FRAMEWORK ABSTRACTION:__ Just means a framework.

__IP:__ Internet Protocol is a set of rules governing the format of data sent over the Internet or other network.

__RESOURCE POOL:__ A logical abstraction for flexible management of resources. They may be grouped into
hierarchies and used to hierarchically partition available CPU and memory resources. (This definition may be
specific to VMware)

__STATIC LANGUAGE:__ A programming language which is optimised according to hardware efficiency in order to make 
code execute as quickly as possible. Notable examples include C, C++. Contrast with __DYNAMIC LANGUAGE.__

__TARBALL:__ _tar,_ derived from (t)ape (ar)chive, is a utility for collective many files into one __archive 
file,__ often referred to as a __tarball,__ which can then be used for distribution or backup purposes.

__TCP:__ Transmission Control Protocol is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network
conversation via which application programs can exchange data. It works with the Internet Protocol (IP).

__UDP:__ User Datagram Protocol is an alternative communications protocol to TCP used primarily for establishing
low-latency and loss tolerating connections between applications on the Internet.
