# Chapter 4 - Working with Docker Images

Every Docker container requires a Docker image, which provides the blueprint for the container's contents.
You can either create your own Dockerfile, or download an image from a registry. A Docker image is made up 
of individual file system layers, corresponding to the individual commands found in the Dockerfile.

Docker uses a __storage backend__ in concert with the underlying Linux filesystem to build and manage the 
filesystem layers that it can then combine into a single usable image. The primary supported storage backends
include __AUFS,__ __BTRFS,__ __Device-mapper__ and __overlayfs,__ each of which provide a fast __copy-on-write
(CoW)__ system for image management.

## Anatomy of a Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is the recipe for your image, and contains all of the steps required to turn a clean Linux
distribution instance into the specific environment your app requires. The Dockerfile will typically be
located in the root directory of your application's source code.

See '3.appendix1.Dockerfile' for an example of a Dockerfile.

Remember that each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new filesystem layer, which Docker stores; this allows
Docker to reuse these layers when other Dockerfiles contain an identical series of instructions. Docker will
always look for an image that contains as many of the same layers as it can before building new layers once 
the Dockerfile's instructions diverge from any existing stored layers.

When you need an image of something that isn't specific to your application, such as a Node instance, you 
could of course build it yourself from a base Linux image, but you could save yourself the trouble and 
see if the Docker Registry has an official image that would do the trick. Node.js provide an up-to-date
selection of images for public use, and all are named and tagged for your convenience. The example Dockerfile
pulls v0.10 of Node from the Docker registry like so:
```
FROM node:0.10
```

The MAINTAINER field simply records the contact details of the Dockerfile's creator:
```
MAINTAINER Sam Broughton <sam@example.com>
```
 
Docker version 1.6 added the ability to add metadata to Docker images through the LABEL command, which
can be handy when searching for particular Docker images and containers:
```
LABEL "rating"="Five Stars" "class"="First Class"
```
You can see the labels attached to an image by `inspect`ing it.

Docker runs all processes as the `root` user by default; you can change user with the `USER` command:
```
USER root
```
Keep in mind that allowing the Docker container to use the `root` user can potentially expose the host system.
Production containers should almost always be run using a non-privileged user.

You can set shell variables using the `ENV` command that can be accessed later in the build process. This allows
you to keep the Dockerfile __DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)__, and can help to avoid typos, particularly when
referencing file paths:
```
ENV AP /data/app
ENV SCPATH /etc/supervisord/conf.d
```
